## Challenges

### 1. Information Asymmetry

> Doctors or hospitals have access to the patient's records, thus making it central


### 2. Data Breaches

### 3. Interoperability (Data Sharing)

> With a number of EHR systems being deployed in various hospitals they have a varying level of terminologies
