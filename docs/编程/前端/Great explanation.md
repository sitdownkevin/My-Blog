Which of the following statements is more declarative?

A. "Knit the dough, roll the dough, add tomato sauce, add cheese, add ham, add pineapple, bake at 200 degrees celsius in a stone oven for...”

**B. “A Hawaiian pizza please.”** 

### What is JSX?

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to describe your UI in a familiar *HTML-like* syntax. The nice thing about JSX is that apart from following [three JSX rules](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx#the-rules-of-jsx), you don’t need to learn any new symbols or syntax outside of HTML and JavaScript.

Note that browsers don’t understand JSX out of the box, so you’ll need a JavaScript compiler, such as a [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), to transform your JSX code into regular JavaScript.

### From Development to Production

- Compiling

- Minifying

- Bundling 

  (webpack)

- Code Splitting
